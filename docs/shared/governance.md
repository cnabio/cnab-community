# Governance

## Project Maintainers
Project maintainers are defined in the CODEOWNERS file of the respective repositories and are responsible for activities around maintaining the project. Final decisions on the project reside with the project maintainers.

Maintainers MUST remain active. If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically removed unless a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3 months.

New maintainers can be added to the project by a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote of the existing maintainers.

A maintainer may step down by submitting an issue stating their intent.
