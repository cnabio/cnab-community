    * https://sched.co/Zeiq (Where to Put All That YAML: Secure Content Management for Cloud Native Apps - Ryan Abrams, Mirantis)
* cnab-go PR bump: https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-go/pull/227
    * we noticed that there is a part of the spec that `cnab-go` is not implementing yet, validating image digests prior to bundle invocation.
    * it seems like it has to be driver specific, but would love feedback to the current implementation, which adds digest validation to the Docker driver.
    * there are some inline questions that would require some feedback.
    * in some cases there can be more than one repo digest - is it acceptable to have exactly one match?
    * Radu: the security spec explicitly invalidates the signature of a bundle if the content digest of an image changed, so I don't think we should allow multiple digests.
    * Jacob: there should only be one digest. In the Kubernetes driver we download by digest, so we pull by that digest, and digest validation is offloaded to the kubelet. 
    * Vaughn: action item - we should revisit https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-go/pull/166
    * Jacob: do we have clarity on what the spec "content digest" refers to? 
    * Radu: I think the wording has been changed to reflect that the "content digest" refers to the manifest digest.
