**AGENDA**

* Demos:
* Short update on TUF/In-Toto design
* alpha/beta releases of spec in run up to 1.0
* Storage of CNABs in registries
    * Feedback on [CNAB to OCI](https://github.com/docker/cnab-to-oci/pull/19) update
* Naming of common credentials
    * May not age well in the spec
    * Align tool builders on common credential names (i.e.: kubeconfig, etc.)
* Would CNAB be an appropriate place to host a spec related to storing multiple content types over OCI? (Josh Dolitsky)
    * OCI maling list discussion: https://groups.google.com/a/opencontainers.org/forum/#!topic/dev/idUW9KWQsBo
* Porter + Lua (Josh Dolitsky)
    * https://github.com/deislabs/porter/issues/173

**NOTES**

* Security currently direction switching from open pgp to [TUF](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary) and [In-Toto](https://in-toto.github.io/)?
* Proposal of third specification on security. Optionally implmentable without affecting cnab core compliance
    * Matt Butcher is working on the draft hopefully finished by the end of the week
    * Questions? 
        * Will this tie into registries? Yes and with notary
        * Will all the specs go v1 at the same time? Currently not sure. 
* Identified security issue in Duffle "duffle docker driver mounts the docker socket for no apparent reason. That gives CNAB invocation images a wide open door to your machine. (Will write an issue on Docker repo for this one) "
* We shouldn't have aplha and beta of the releases to stop fragmentation. When will the core part of the spec be v1.
    * Move fast on cnab core and get it to v1
    * What is the current rate of change and how many tools implement the specificiation
* Chris proposing CNAB to OCI tool be used to store bundles in registries
* Where should the CNAB registry storage conversation be had?
* Discussion around tight coupling of image spec and distribution spec
    * Challenging to make changes to OCI distribution to make it a generic store because every tool has different use-cases
    * Annotations are the best way forward with custom types
    * Start with standard agreed upon key then move forward with the implementation
    * DECISION: Move forward with CNAB to OCI and continue discussion in OCI distribution. Agree on annotation across communities. Simon to help with pulling CNAB to OCI into Docker-app
    * CNAB to OCI doesn't currently support thin-bundles.Simon and Chris to raise issue to hash out the detail
        * Thin bundle = main OCI Index + config blob
        * Thick bundle = Thin bundle + deep copy of everything linked by the main OCI index
* Well known custom actions - https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/blob/main/805-well-known-custom-actions.md
* Porter mixin for CNAB that makes a single bundle from multiple bundles
    * As soon as the spec has any way to communicate outputs between bundles then we could compose bundles as you suggest. Until then I think it would be a bit clunky. Like you could run a bunch of bundles, but without being able to pass data between them, it wouldn’t be as useful as I would want, no?
    * Jeremy has proposal and will open PR

**ACTION ITEMS**
* https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/blob/main/101-bundle-json.md#the-image-map -> refs and image map injection at runtime is redundant
    * https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/113
