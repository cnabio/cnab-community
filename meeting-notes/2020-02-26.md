### Agenda

- CNAB registry spec (Chris Crone/Docker, Radu) - [working document](https://hackmd.io/@UttpSA1cSfWU-VNqaNJATw/HySy-hQEI/edit)
    - Chris, Silvin, Radu, and Trishank will discuss and collaborate over Slack
- [establishing trust for multiple registries (`cnab-spec #332`)](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/332) (Trishank, Glyn)
    - Radu and Trishank agreed that this is something that should be discussed in general terms in the Security spec, but for which the spec should not propose any restrictive opinion. However, bundle runtimes are free to be opinionated on this mater.
- present the CNAB [scenarios document](https://hackmd.io/@radu/By3G7Ni7L) for Notary v2 (Trishank, Radu)
    - Radu and Trishank attending the meeting
    - We will file an issue on the Notary v2 about key management, especially delegations
- [the media type used doesn't meet the OCI artifact spec (`cnab-to-oci`#100)](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-to-oci/issues/100)
    - Radu: this is technically correct
    - Matt thinks we should make it `application/vnd.cnab.cnab.config.v1+json`
    - Silvin: should it be `cnab` or `cnab.io`? Radu doesn't have a strong opinion this. Silvin is good with Matt's proposition.
- initial CODEOWNERS for Signy ([signy #69](https://github.com/cnabio/signy/pull/69)) (Radu)
    - Silvin has no objections
- clarify contentDigest meaning for docker/OCI images[`cnab-spec#287`](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/287) (Radu)
    - Radu: this is a long-running issue. It is also a tooling issue, confirmed by Justin Cormack at the Notary v2 meeting, who said that `containerd` issues reliable digests that works across registries.
    - Silvin: this is something that we can try with `cnab-to-oci`, especially with registries that support CNAB.
- updates on key management in `signy`
    - push `snapshot` key to Notary
    - reuse `targets` key across bundles
    - working on delegations
    - Radu: biggest concern I have is on whether we can achieve the delegations we need for in-toto w/ Notary v1, or whether we need to fork in-toto and / or Notary.
    - Radu: another option is to refer to `pysigny`, which uses `python-tuf`, to make this work.
    - Trishank to figure this out before next Security meeting.
    - Radu: this and 304 are the only things blocking Security spec right now. If we are clear enough on delegations, we can call for a vote in a month's time.
