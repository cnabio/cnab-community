* [according to the meeting notes from April 29th](https://hackmd.io/TfLYtyRnS8Kfx4ekgLwWLg?both#April-29th---General-Meeting), @carolynvs is also a spec maintainer, but the OWNERS file has not been updated.
    * [PR to add Carolyn to the OWNERS file](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/377)
    * is the [OWNERS](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/blob/main/OWNERS) file up-to-date?
    * **Radu** will submit a PR to remove Simon from the owners file since he is working on other things and Silvin is taking his place for now


* [CNAB Security 1.0 GA vote](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/376)
    * according to the [process document: ](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/blob/main/901-process.md#appendix-a-the-process-of-developing-the-specification)
    * > GA: Working Group Approval indicates that this version has been accepted by the maintainers, but not accepted by the Executive Directors. In practice, this marker MUST only be used internally for testing, and never for production.
    * does it need 2/3 supermajority?
        * Crone - to be safe we can go with 2/3
        * Ralph wants everyone to sign off, or go on record with their objection. Ralph volunteers as whip.
        * THANK YOU TRISHANK!!! üéâ‚ù§Ô∏è
        * Ralph - longer term let's have the EA team fix the docs to be more clear
    * **Carolyn** will review with her new magic codeowner abilities
    * Ralph will set up working example repos in github so that people can try this out, in collaboration with the Microsoft CDA team and GitHub's developer evangelism team

* [CNAB Registry draft](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/362)
    * needs review - addressed feedback, rebased
    * **Carolyn** will review
    * Just need 2 LGTMs so we can merge a draft and keep iterating.

* PR review(s) requested:
  *  https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-go/pull/219
      *  This lets parameters have the same set of features as credentials: mapped from env vars, files, secrets, etc.

* Ralph - next 6 months is working on showing all the different ways that we can use CNAB in open source
    * ‚ÄúConvincing people to sign commits, or other impossible tasks. ‚Äù
